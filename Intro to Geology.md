# <center>Introduction to Physical Geology: (Fall 2013)
![](images/earthquakes.jpg)

## Course Description
This course focuses on the Earth’s composition, structure, and systems.  We will investigate the processes at work within the Earth as well as surface processes that shape the Earth’s surface.  We will examine how geologic phenomena are linked together through dynamic systems and how they impact our environment, society and economy.  Topics of discussion will include but are not limited to: rocks and minerals, earthquakes, the oceans, the atmosphere, weathering, groundwater, glaciers, volcanoes and plate tectonics (not necessarily in that order).

## Course Goals
1. To obtain a general knowledge of geology and Earth systems.
2. To develop the necessary skills to evaluate scientific claims and hypotheses.
3. To develop a respect and curiosity for processes driving the ever-changing face of Earth.
4. To investigate the interrelationship between the Earth and humans.

## Expected Learning Outcomes

## Class Expectations
1. I expect you to attend class and require you to attend lab.
2. I expect that you are here to learn, participate and collaborate
3. I expect you to treat your peers with respect.
4. I expect you to arrive on time and remain in class until the end of the period.
5. I expect you to ask questions and not take my word as gospel.
6. I expect you to challenge yourself, your peers and your instructor.

## Textbook
[*Physical Geology: Exploring the Earth*](http://www.amazon.com/Physical-Geology-Exploring-CengageNOW-Printed/dp/0495011487), 6th Edition – by Monroe, Wicander, and Hazlett 
You are responsible for additional readings that are accessible via Moodle (identified with an M in the course schedule below).

##Laboratory Exercises
I will provide explicit instructions and expectations with each laboratory exercise that I assign.  Every exercise is due at the beginning of the next lab period unless I notify you otherwise (see late work policy below).  If the exercise requires us to go outside I will notify you a week in advance.

## Course Evaluation
Your grade will be assessed using three hour-long examinations, a final exam, slide discussions, homework assignments, two short research papers, and laboratory exercises.  Exams will include objective and essay type questions and I will provide samples prior to each exam.  Although I don’t require attendance, we will complete exercises in class and if you fail to attend class or arrive late you will not be allowed to make-up these assignments.  You are required to complete the assigned readings prior to class and must complete assignments on time for credit.  Notice that the majority of emphasis is placed on applied skills derived from courses content (e.g. – labs are worth more than exams); I do this intentionally because I want you to become comfortable USING information from this class and not just memorizing for exams.

## Course Policies
***Attendance***

You are expected to attend lecture sessions.  I do not believe in penalizing students for absences, however you will still be held responsible for material covered in class and will not be allowed to make up quizzes or homework assignments.  I will keep track of attendance for administrative reasons, but it will not be incorporated into your course grade.  You are required to attend laboratory sessions.  Lab set up is often time consuming and requires access to college resources.  Therefore, if you miss a lab without notifying me in advance or providing written documentation of the circumstances under which you were unable to attend, you will not be allowed to make up the exercise.
Homework/Laboratory Assignment Policy
All finished work will be uploaded to Moodle rather than provided in paper format (unless notified otherwise).  I don’t want the excess paper trail and it is easier for me to make comments digitally and easier for you to read them (rather than struggling through my chicken scratch).  

***Exams***
Exams test you on material covered in the book & handouts, in class and in lab.  Some questions will cover material covered in the book or handouts but not in class, SO you still need to read the book and handouts.  It is your responsibility to notify me by the end of the second week of classes if you have a scheduling conflict with any of the exam dates.  Only absences related to college activities or religious holidays are acceptable.

You will not succeed on my exams using pure memorization, you MUST understand the material!  We will discuss exam format in more detail as exam 1 approaches, but waiting until the night before any exam will not be helpful.
  
***Research Papers***

You are responsible for writing two short (5-8 pages) research papers over the course of the semester. The first is due 

***Late Work***

I have a zero tolerance policy for late work.  If you hand in late work, you will receive zero credit for the assignment (unless you can provide with documentation that clearly states why your work is late).  If you think you might encounter computer issues then submit your work well ahead of the deadline, if you can’t get the document to print - email it to me, if your email is down, then put it on a disk and slip it under my door.  Excuses will get you fired in the “real world.”

I employ this strict policy because I don’t believe in a system that supports inequity between peers (e.g. – why should you get an extra day or two when your classmate hands theirs in on time?).  I have also had numerous students thank me for keeping them to task and not allowing them to get behind in assignments.  OBVIOUSLY there is an exception to every rule, but exception is the key word. 

***Academic Honesty***

If you are caught cheating or plagiarizing (as outlined in the [*College Catalog*](http://www.greenmtn.edu/academic-catalog/2011_academic_catalog/academic-policies/academic-integrity.aspx)), you will receive an F for the course and your name will be submitted to the Student Judicial Board.  We will define and discuss plagiarism in class.


***Learning Center Accommodations***

If you have a specific learning, physical, or psychiatric disability and require accommodations, please let me know early in the semester so that your learning needs may be appropriately met.  The Calhoun Learning Center is the office responsible for coordinating accommodations for students and is located on the 3rd floor of Griswold Library.  If you have questions, please contact Christina Fabrey, Coordinator of Accommodations, at x8234.


## <center>Course Schedule
This schedule is only a road map and designed to be dynamic.  However, I will try to provide as much notice as possible prior to any changes in the schedule.  Note that the letter M refers to papers available on the Moodle Course Folder.

## Guidelines for Success
These are some general guidelines that will help you succeed in this class:

1. Attend every class – research indicates grades improve with attendance
2. Learn and understand the material rather than just memorizing it for the exams
3. Come to class prepared – read the assigned text & develop your own questions before class
4. Complete and hand your work in on time
5. Learn to ‘play well with others’. Group work is essential for developing good communication and listening skills
6. Become an active participant in the learning process.  This means you need to actively study, take notes, ask questions and develop your own questions.
